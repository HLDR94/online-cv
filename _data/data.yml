      details: |
      My job was to ensure that my platoon had strong and secure communications 
      when on training exercises and in any potential conflicts. Due to the nature of this job, the role was extremely
      demanding and technical. I was trusted with sensitive and expensive equipment that was paramount 
      to the successful completion of any military operation. When I wasn’t in the field, I was maintaining
      the equipment and teaching fellow soldiers how to use a vast spectrum of communication systems.
